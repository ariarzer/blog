        <h2>I am a UI-developer with 4.5 years of experience. Now i am a digital nomad.</h2>

        <p>Now i work in Cube.dev, in the marketing team. We are responsible for making people know about Cube. We care
            about documentation, blog, and pages with use-cases, examples, and more. Here are two developers and two
            designers. I make UI and work closely with designers and my colleague develop business logic.</p>

        <p>My previous work was in VKontakte. This the biggest Russian social network, maybe youâ€™ve heard about it. Most
            of the time I worked in Frontend infrastructure team. My biggest accomplishment was the implementation of
            the design-token system and the creation dark theme for the whole VK based on them. It helped us to improve
            accessibility a lot and be more flexible to change the brand color.</p>

        <p>In my free time, i blog about CSS, which is famous in Russian developers community, and hold a speech at
            conferences, again about CSS. My last one was about colors in CSS: how many ways are the for defining it,
            what is the difference between them, and how we can use it in our work.</p>

        <p>So, a really care about UI, i like to work closely with designers, i can understand what they want and can
            make a system to help other developers create that in a faster and better way. I am familiar either with
            developing design-system for product interfaces and attractive landings. Also, I am constantly learning new
            things about CSS and other areas of the frontend and doing public activities about it.</p>
